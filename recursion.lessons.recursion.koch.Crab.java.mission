<h2>Fractal Crab</h2>

<p>The Crab curve is not exactly a Koch curve, but that's still a fractal and it's built rather similarly. 
This time, we grow square triangle on the side of the figure: the angle is 45 degrees, and the length is divided by 
Math.sqrt(2) at each step.</p> 

<p>Check the figures produced by the first steps of recursion to understand the pattern.</p> 

<h3>Bibliographical note</h3>
<p>This curve, also called the Lévy C curve was invented in 1938 by the French mathematician Paul Lévy in 1938. 
As usual, the wikipedia page is very instructive, and the page provide a very good additions:
