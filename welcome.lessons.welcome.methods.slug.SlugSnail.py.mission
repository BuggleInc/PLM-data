<h2>Slugs and Snails</h2>

<p>Yuhu! This time, your buggle found the tracks of much more preys! In the first world, that's a yummy Kitty 
Slug (leaving a pink trail) while on the second world, that's a big fat snail that awaits your buggle at the end of 
the orange trail.</p>

<p>You have to copy/paste your code again, and change it so that your methods take the color of the trail to 
follow as a parameter. Beside of this, your code should work as earlier.</p>
