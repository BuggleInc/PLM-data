The world 'Grid' differs:
  In (0,1), the ground reads '14' (expected: '13').
  In (0,3), the ground reads '28' (expected: '27').
  In (0,5), the ground reads '42' (expected: '41').
  In (5,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '47').
  In (6,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '48').
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (5,6); expected: (6,6).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
