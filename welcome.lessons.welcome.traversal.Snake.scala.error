The world 'Desert' differs:
  In (2,0), the ground is expected to be red, but it is white.
  In (3,0), the ground is expected to be red, but it is white.
  In (4,0), the ground is expected to be red, but it is white.
  In (5,0), the ground is expected to be red, but it is white.
  In (6,0), the ground is expected to be red, but it is white.
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Snake':
    Its position is (1,0); expected: (6,0).
