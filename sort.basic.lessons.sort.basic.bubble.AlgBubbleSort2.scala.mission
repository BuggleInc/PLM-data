<h1>BubbleSort (take 2)</h1>

<p>If you look carefully at the behavior of BubbleSort, a first easy
optimization appears: after one traversal, the last element of the array
must be the biggest of all since the traversal moved it up like a bubble to
its position. More generally, after N traversal, we know that the N last
elements of the array are already sorted. It is thus not necessary to
compare them again during the subsequent traversals. For now, we will have
as many traversal as there is in the array.</p>

<a href="#tip-2">Show Tip (Pseudo-code)</a>

<p>When we run this algorithm, it is quite disappointing to see that it runs
approximately at the same speed than the basic version of BubbleSort. This
is a graphical effect only since only value changes are graphically
represented. Since this variation avoids some useless comparisons, it does
exactly the same amount of swaps that the basic version. It is thus quite
logical that the graphical interface draws this version at the same pace
than the base version. But the statistics on the amount of reads show that we
saved about the fourth of the amount of reads, which is not bad.</p>

<p>From the asymptotic complexity point of view, there is absolutely no
difference: this variation is still in O(n^2) on average (our gain is only
on the constant term, ignored when computing the asymptotic complexity).</p>
