<html><body><b>Your entity failed to start. Did you forgot to put your code within a method?</b><br/>This problem often arises when the exercise expects you to put all the code within a method e.g. <code>run()</code>, but you put some statements (e.g. forward()) outside of any method.</br>The easiest solution to sort it out is to copy all your code (Ctrl-A Ctrl-C), use the 'Exercise/Revert' menu to reset the exercise template, and paste (Ctrl-V) your previous code <i>within</i> the template.
