The world 'Grid' differs:
  In (0,1), the ground reads '130' (expected: '1').
  In (0,2), the ground reads '332' (expected: '3').
  In (0,3), the ground reads '634' (expected: '6').
  In (0,4), the ground reads '1036' (expected: '10').
  In (0,5), the ground reads '1538' (expected: '15').
  In (0,6), the ground reads '2140' (expected: '21').
  In (1,1), the ground reads '429' (expected: '4').
  In (1,2), the ground reads '731' (expected: '7').
  In (1,3), the ground reads '1133' (expected: '11').
  In (1,4), the ground reads '1635' (expected: '16').
  In (1,5), the ground reads '2237' (expected: '22').
  In (1,6), the ground reads '2839' (expected: '28').
  In (2,5), the ground reads '' (expected: '29').
  In (2,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '34').
  In (3,4), the ground reads '' (expected: '30').

  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (0,6); expected: (6,6).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
