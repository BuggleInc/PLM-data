<h2>Do .. while loops</h2>

<p>Some cells of the world are yellow, but your buggle cannot stand being in 
such cells. Write the necessary code to move forward until the ground 
gets white. For that, use the provided method <code>isGroundWhite()</code>.</p>

<p>The trick is that most buggles of this world are currently on this yellow ground 
that they dislike so much. That is why they are in panic, and every buggle rushes 
one cell forward, even the buggle that was not on a yellow cell at first. In other worlds,  
even if the ground is white on the first cell, you still want to move forward to the next cell.</p>    

<p>The general idea is to do something like: </p>
<pre>move forward until located in a white cell</pre>

<p>The main difficulty is that we want this loop body to be executed once, even we are already on a white cell. 
It would be easy to do so by duplicating the loop content before the actual loop, but this would be a bad idea: 
code duplication is a <b>very</b> bad habit, and you should <b>always</b> avoid it.</p>

<p>Code duplication easily turns code maintenance into a nightmare: reading the code becomes difficult as the reader must ensure 
that no slight difference exist between the versions. Debugging the code becomes difficult, as bugs have to be fixed 
in all versions. Actually, every modification of the code becomes difficult. So, really, you should <b>always</b> 
strive to not duplicate your code if you can avoid. And the good news is that you always can...</p>

<h3>Executing the loop body at least once</h3>





<pre>do {
    <b>action()</b>
} while (<b>condition</b>)</pre></p>
