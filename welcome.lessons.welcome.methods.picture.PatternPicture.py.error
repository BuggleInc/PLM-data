The world 'World' differs:
  In (2,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255].
  In (2,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  In (3,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (3,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255].
  In (3,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Picasso':
    Its position is (0,3); expected: (4,3).
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
