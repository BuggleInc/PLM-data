The world 'Grid' differs:
  In (0,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '42').
  In (1,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '43').
  In (2,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '44').
  In (3,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '45').
  In (4,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '46').
  In (5,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '47').
  In (6,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '48').
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (0,5); expected: (6,6).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
