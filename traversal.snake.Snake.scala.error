The world 'Desert' differs:
  In (2,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (3,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (4,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (5,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (6,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Snake':
    Its position is (1,0); expected: (6,0).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
