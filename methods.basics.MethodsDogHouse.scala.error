The world 'World' differs:
  In (3,4), the ground is expected to be white, but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (5,3), the ground is expected to be white, but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Puppy':
    Its position is (0,6); expected: (3,6).
    Its direction is SOUTH; expected: WEST.
