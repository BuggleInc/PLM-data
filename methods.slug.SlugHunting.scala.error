The world 'Forrest' differs:
  In (0,1), there shouldn't be this baggle, the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (1,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (2,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (2,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (2,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (2,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (3,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (4,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (4,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (4,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (5,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (6,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (6,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (6,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Hunter':
    Its position is (6,5); expected: (0,1).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192].
