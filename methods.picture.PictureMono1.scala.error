  In (0,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is white.
  In (0,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is white.

  Something is wrong about buggle 'Picasso':
    Its position is (2,0); expected: (0,6).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192].
