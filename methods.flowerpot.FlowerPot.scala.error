The world 'Pot' differs:
  In (4,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0], but it is green.
  In (5,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0], but it is green.
  In (5,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is yellow.
  In (5,7), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0], but it is green.
  In (6,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (6,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0], but it is green.
  In (6,7), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (7,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Van Gogh':
    Its position is (6,6); expected: (1,6).
    Its direction is EAST; expected: EAST.
