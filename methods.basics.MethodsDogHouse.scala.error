The world 'World' differs:
  In (1,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (1,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (1,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (1,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.

  Something is wrong about buggle 'Puppy':
    Its position is (2,6); expected: (3,6).
    Its direction is EAST; expected: WEST.
