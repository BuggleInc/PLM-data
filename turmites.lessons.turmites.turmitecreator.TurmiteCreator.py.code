# Your code should be something like 
#  nbSteps = 42;
#  rule = [[ [0, NOTURN, 0], [0, NOTURN, 0] ]];

# You can change the initial position of the turmite with setX()/setY() methods

# You can possibly have more states (ie, bigger second dimension), and more colors (ie, bigger third --internal-- dimension) 
# Naturally, less boring turmites are easy to achieve since this one runs forward endlessly
