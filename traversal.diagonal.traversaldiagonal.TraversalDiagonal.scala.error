  In (0,4), the ground reads '1041' (expected: '10').
  In (0,5), the ground reads '1535' (expected: '15').
  In (0,6), the ground reads '2128' (expected: '21').
  In (1,1), the ground reads '454' (expected: '4').
  In (1,2), the ground reads '751' (expected: '7').
  In (1,3), the ground reads '1147' (expected: '11').
  In (1,4), the ground reads '1642' (expected: '16').
  In (1,5), the ground reads '2236' (expected: '22').
  In (1,6), the ground reads '29' (expected: '28').
  In (2,2), the ground reads '1252' (expected: '12').
  In (2,3), the ground reads '1748' (expected: '17').
  In (2,4), the ground reads '2343' (expected: '23').
  In (2,5), the ground reads '37' (expected: '29').
  In (2,6), the ground reads '30' (expected: '34').
  In (3,3), the ground reads '2449' (expected: '24').
  In (3,4), the ground reads '44' (expected: '30').
  In (3,5), the ground reads '38' (expected: '35').
  In (3,6), the ground reads '31' (expected: '39').
  In (4,3), the ground reads '' (expected: '31').
  In (4,4), the ground reads '45' (expected: '36').
  In (4,5), the ground reads '39' (expected: '40').
  In (4,6), the ground reads '32' (expected: '43').
  In (5,2), the ground reads '' (expected: '32').
  In (5,3), the ground reads '' (expected: '37').
  In (5,4), the ground reads '' (expected: '41').
  In (5,5), the ground reads '40' (expected: '44').

  In (6,1), the ground reads '' (expected: '33').
  In (6,2), the ground reads '' (expected: '38').
  In (6,3), the ground reads '' (expected: '42').
  In (6,4), the ground reads '' (expected: '45').
  In (6,5), the ground reads '' (expected: '47').
  In (6,6), the ground reads '34' (expected: '48').
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (0,0); expected: (6,6).
    Its direction is NORTH; expected: NORTH.
