The world 'Flower display case' differs:
  In (7,12), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (8,11), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (8,12), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (8,13), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (9,12), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (13,7), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (14,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=255].
  In (15,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=255].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Jessie':
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=175,b=175]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0].
