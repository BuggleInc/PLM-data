The world 'Grid' differs:
  In (2,5), the ground reads '2934' (expected: '29').
  In (2,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '34').
  In (3,4), the ground reads '303539' (expected: '30').
  In (3,5), the ground reads '' (expected: '35').
  In (3,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '39').
  In (4,3), the ground reads '31364043' (expected: '31').
  In (4,4), the ground reads '' (expected: '36').
  In (4,5), the ground reads '' (expected: '40').
  In (4,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '43').
  In (5,2), the ground reads '3237414446' (expected: '32').
  In (5,3), the ground reads '' (expected: '37').
  In (5,4), the ground reads '' (expected: '41').
  In (5,5), the ground reads '' (expected: '44').
  In (5,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '46').
  In (6,1), the ground reads '3338424547' (expected: '33').
  In (6,2), the ground reads '' (expected: '38').
  In (6,3), the ground reads '' (expected: '42').
  In (6,4), the ground reads '' (expected: '45').
  In (6,5), the ground reads '' (expected: '47').
  In (6,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '48').
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (6,1); expected: (6,6).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
