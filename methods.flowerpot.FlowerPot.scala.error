The world 'Pot' differs:
  In (2,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=175,b=175], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (2,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (2,7), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=175,b=175], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (3,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=175,b=175], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
  In (5,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=155,b=0].
