The world 'Stairway to heaven' differs:
  In (0,0), the ground is expected to be white, but it is pink.
  In (0,8), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'buggle2':
    Its position is (0,0); expected: (14,0).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=175,b=175]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=175,b=175].
