Your entity failed to start. Did you forgot to put your code within a method?

This problem often arises when the exercise expects you to put all the code within a 
method e.g. run(), but you put some statements (e.g. forward()) outside of any method.

The easiest solution to sort it out is to copy all your code (Ctrl-A Ctrl-C), use the 
'Exercise/Revert' menu to reset the template, and paste (Ctrl-V) your code within the
provided method.
