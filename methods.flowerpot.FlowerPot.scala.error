The world 'Pot' differs:
  In (1,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=175,b=175], but it is green.
  In (2,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=175,b=175], but it is green.
  In (2,7), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=175,b=175], but it is green.
  In (3,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=175,b=175], but it is green.
  In (5,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is pink.
  In (6,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is pink.
  In (6,7), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is pink.
  In (7,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is pink.
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Van Gogh':
    Its position is (1,2); expected: (1,6).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0].
