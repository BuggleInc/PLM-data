<h1>Fizz Buzz</h1>
<p>According to Wikipedia, Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "Fizz", 
and any number divisible by five with the word "Buzz". Any number that is divisible by both three and five 
is replaced with the string "Fizz Buzz". </p>

<p>Unchanged numbers are simply returned as a string.
The easiest for that is to use that Java idiomatic: <code>""+a</code>
