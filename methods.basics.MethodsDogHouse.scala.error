The world 'World' differs:
  In (1,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (1,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (1,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (1,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (1,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (2,4), the ground is expected to be white, but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (4,0), the ground is expected to be white, but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Puppy':
    Its position is (2,4); expected: (3,6).
    Its direction is SOUTH; expected: WEST.
