Le monde 'indexOfValue' diffère:
indexOfValue(Array(2,-3,1,17,-13,5,3,1,9,18),17) returned -1 while 3 were expected.
indexOfValue(Array(-9,-11,-1,-10,-8,10,-9,0,0,-4,-12,-12,4,17,3),-9) returned -9 while 0 were expected.
indexOfValue(Array(-9,11,-7,16,11,-12,1,16,17,12,18,18,-7,-14,16,-9,14,-8,18,-9),11) returned -1 while 1 were expected.
