The world 'Grid' differs:
  In (0,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '6').

  In (2,4), the ground reads '16' (expected: '18').
  In (2,5), the ground reads '17' (expected: '19').
  In (2,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '20').
  In (3,0), the ground reads '18' (expected: '21').

  In (3,4), the ground reads '22' (expected: '25').
  In (3,5), the ground reads '23' (expected: '26').
  In (3,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '27').

  In (4,4), the ground reads '28' (expected: '32').
  In (4,5), the ground reads '29' (expected: '33').
  In (4,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '34').
  In (5,0), the ground reads '30' (expected: '35').
  In (5,1), the ground reads '31' (expected: '36').
  In (5,2), the ground reads '32' (expected: '37').

  In (5,4), the ground reads '34' (expected: '39').
  In (5,5), the ground reads '35' (expected: '40').
  In (5,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '41').
  In (6,0), the ground reads '' (expected: '42').
  In (6,1), the ground reads '' (expected: '43').
  In (6,2), the ground reads '' (expected: '44').
  In (6,3), the ground reads '' (expected: '45').
  In (6,4), the ground reads '' (expected: '46').
  In (6,5), the ground reads '' (expected: '47').
  In (6,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '48').
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (5,5); expected: (6,6).
