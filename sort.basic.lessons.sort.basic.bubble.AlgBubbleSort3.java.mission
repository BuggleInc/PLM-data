<h1>BubbleSort (take 3)</h1>

<p>Let's now reintroduce the little optimization we removed at previous step:
if a traversal does not swap any element, it means that the array is already
sorted. In that case, we want to stop the whole sorting process.</p>

<p>
  For that, simply use the <code>break</code> keyword, which breaks the current loop.
                Beware, if you have several nested loops, this will apply to the internal one.

<a href="#tip-3">If you want, this tip shows the pseudo-code.</a>

<p>This optimization is even more disappointing: it only provide a gain of a few
percents on the amount of reads over BubbleSort2.</p>
