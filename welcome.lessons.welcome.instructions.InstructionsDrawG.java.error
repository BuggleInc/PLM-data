The world 'Training World' differs:
  In (1,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  In (1,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  In (1,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  In (1,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  In (1,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  In (2,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255].
  In (2,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255].
  In (2,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255].
  In (4,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Rookie':
    Its position is (4,1); expected: (5,1).
