<h1>DateFashion</h1>
You and your
date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter "you" is
the stylishness of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and "date" is the
stylishness of your date's clothes. The result getting the table is
encoded as an int value with 0=no, 1=maybe, 2=yes. If either of you is
very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). With the exception
that if either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0
(no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).
