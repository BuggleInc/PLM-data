The world 'World' differs:
  In (2,2), the ground is expected to be white, but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (4,5), the ground is expected to be white, but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (6,4), the ground is expected to be white, but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Puppy':
    Its position is (6,4); expected: (3,6).
    Its direction is EAST; expected: WEST.
