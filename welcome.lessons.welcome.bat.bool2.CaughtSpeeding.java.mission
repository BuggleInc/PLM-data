<h1>CaughtSpeeding</h1>
You are
driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code
to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small
ticket, 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed
is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or
more, the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your
speed can be 5 higher in all cases.
