The world 'New world' differs:
  In (3,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=42,g=42,b=42].
  In (3,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=42,g=42,b=42].
  In (3,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=42,g=42,b=42].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'buggle1':
    Its position is (3,2); expected: (3,4).
