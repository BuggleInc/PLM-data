The world 'World' differs:
  In (0,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (0,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (1,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (2,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (2,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (3,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (3,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (4,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  In (4,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Picasso':
    Its position is (6,6); expected: (0,6).
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192].
