The world 'Island' differs:
  In (11,5), there shouldn't be this baggle.
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Thesee':
    Its position is (5,5); expected: (11,5).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
