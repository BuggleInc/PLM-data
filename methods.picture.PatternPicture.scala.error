  In (1,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0], but it is blue.
  In (1,5), the ground is expected to be white, but it is green.
  In (2,6), the ground is expected to be white, but it is green.
  In (3,3), the ground is expected to be white, but it is red.
  In (3,6), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is yellow.
  In (4,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0], but it is white.
  In (4,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (4,4), the ground is expected to be white, but it is red.
  In (5,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0], but it is white.
  In (5,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (6,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is white.
  In (6,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is white.
  In (7,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is white.
  In (7,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255], but it is white.
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Picasso':
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
