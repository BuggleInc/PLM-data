<h2>Snow flake</h2>

We will now draw snow flakes using the Koch fractal. A fractal is a
geometric pattern repeated at every scale.

<p>The general form is a triangle, with each side given by several recursive
calls. Your work is only to write the code of the <code>snowSide</code> method so 
that it draws one side of the triangle. To make it easier, each sides are represented 
in a specific color. Just draw the red things (without changing your pen color), 
and the other colors will be drawn automatically. </p>

<p>Observe the drawing in each world's objective to understand the pattern's
logic, and then reproduce it. At level 0, the Koch curve is just a straight line. 
At level 1, the curve is divided in three thirds, and the middle part is replaced by 
the two sides of an equilateral triangle of the same length as the segment being removed.
At level 2, the process is repeated, whith each segments split in three parts and the 
middle part being replaced by the two sides of an equilateral triangle.</p>

<p>At the end, here is the pseudo-code of the general case (you should add the base case yourself):</p>
<pre>
  Move forward of the desired length
  Draw (recursively) the right subtree
  Draw (recursively) the left subtree
  Move back to your initial position
</pre> 
<p>To draw the right subtree, you have to turn right and then draw the subtree.</p>

<p><a href="#tip-1">Too much letters. Please picture it.</a></p>

<p>You must write the <code>snowSide()</code> method, which is recursive but 
<b>do not call snowFlake from snowSide</b>, or you will get very strange and unexpected 
behaviors.</p>
