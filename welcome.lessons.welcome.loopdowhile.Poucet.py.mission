<h2>Tracks of buggles</h2>

<p>Your buggle got lost in a strange maze, and you must help it to find the exit that is represented in orange.
You cannot simply explain the path to the exit in something like <code>right();forward();forward();forward()</code> 
because you have to save two buggles at the same time, that are lost in similar but not identical worlds. 
You can switch to the other world by using the combobox above the world representation (where it's written 
'Deep Forest' right now), and selecting the other entry (that should read 'Deeper Forest').</p>

<p>The good news is that the path to the exit is written on the ground. As you can see, the world is made 
of several corridors, with baggles on the ground. After each corridor, you should turn left if the corridor contains
three baggels or more, and you have to turn right if there is only 2 baggles or less.</p>

<p>You should count exactly 5 cells per corridor, the one at the intersection counting as the last cell of the 
previous corridor, not as the first cell after your turn. </p>     

<p>So, the general form of your code must be something like "while I did not find the exit, take the next corridor 
to decide whether I should turn left or right at the next intersection". You can determine whether you are on the 
exit cell (that is orange) with the provided <code>exitReached()</code> method.</p>

<p>To take one corridor, you simply have to run from one intersection to another while counting the baggles you see 
on your path. The method <code>crossing()</code> tells you whether your buggle currently stands on an intersection. 
The extra complexity is that at the beginning of a corridor, you obviously stand on an intersection, but you still want to move on.

For that, use an extra variable indicating whether you already entered the
corridor,  as follows. This will ensure that you execute the loop body at least once (when
<code>firstTime</code> is true) before we actually use the value returned by
<code>crossing()</code> to determine to continue or not.</p>


<pre>firstTime = True
while firstTime or not crossing():
  firstTime = False
  (loop body)
</pre>
 

<p><a href="#tip-1">I cannot imagine how to count the baggles I see.</a></p>

<p>Oh, and when you reach the exit, don't forget to take an extra step to actually exit the maze!</p>
