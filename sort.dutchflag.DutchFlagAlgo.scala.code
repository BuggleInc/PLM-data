/*
Do a traversal over your data, saving 3 indices:

    afterBlue is initialized to 0. Make sure that every cell below afterBlue is filled with blue elements.
    whiteRed is initialized to size-1. Make sure that every cell after whiteRed is filled with red elements.
    beforeWhite is initialized to size-1. Make sure that every cell after beforeWhite and before whiteRed is filled with white elements.

Note that the unsorted cells are always between afterBlue and beforeWhite.
At each step of your traversal, check the color of the cell at afterBlue and do the required exchanges. The loop ending condition is when afterBlue becomes larger than beforeWhite.
