The world 'Pattern 1' differs:
  In (1,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  In (2,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=255], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  In (3,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
