The world 'Grid' differs:
  In (0,1), the ground reads '7' (expected: '13').
  In (0,3), the ground reads '21' (expected: '27').
  In (0,5), the ground reads '35' (expected: '41').
  In (1,1), the ground reads '8' (expected: '12').
  In (1,3), the ground reads '22' (expected: '26').
  In (1,5), the ground reads '36' (expected: '40').
  In (2,1), the ground reads '9' (expected: '11').
  In (2,3), the ground reads '23' (expected: '25').
  In (2,5), the ground reads '37' (expected: '39').
  In (4,1), the ground reads '11' (expected: '9').
  In (4,3), the ground reads '25' (expected: '23').
  In (4,5), the ground reads '39' (expected: '37').
  In (5,1), the ground reads '12' (expected: '8').
  In (5,3), the ground reads '26' (expected: '22').
  In (5,5), the ground reads '40' (expected: '36').
  In (6,1), the ground reads '13' (expected: '7').
  In (6,3), the ground reads '27' (expected: '21').
  In (6,5), the ground reads '41' (expected: '35').
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (-1,-1); expected: (6,6).
