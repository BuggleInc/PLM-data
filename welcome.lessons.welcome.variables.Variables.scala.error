 found   : Null(null)
 required: Int
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method Integer2intNullConflict in class LowPriorityImplicits of type (x: Null)Int
 and method Integer2int in object Predef of type (x: Integer)Int
 are possible conversion functions from Null(null) to Int
