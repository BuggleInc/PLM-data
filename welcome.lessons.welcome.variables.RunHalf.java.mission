<h2>The Four Halves run</h2>

<p>Here is the second day of the Big Buggles' Race.  
As previously, you have to run forward until you reach the right cell to stop on. 
But this time, you have to reach the cell where the amount of baggles
you saw is the double of the orange cells plus 1. 
In other words, the following condition must become true: <code>2 * baggles = orangeCells + 1</code>.</p>

<p>You can determine whether you are over a orange cell with the <code>isOverOrange()</code> method.</p>
