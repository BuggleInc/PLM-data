The world 'Pot' differs:
  In (5,2), the ground is expected to be cyan, but it is blue.
  In (6,1), the ground is expected to be cyan, but it is blue.
  In (6,3), the ground is expected to be cyan, but it is blue.
  In (7,2), the ground is expected to be cyan, but it is blue.
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Van Gogh':
    Its position is (4,4); expected: (1,6).
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=200,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=0].
