The world 'World' differs:
  In (0,2), the ground is expected to be light grey, but it is white.
  In (0,4), the ground is expected to be light grey, but it is white.
  In (1,3), the ground is expected to be light grey, but it is white.
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Picasso':
    Its position is (1,0); expected: (0,6).
