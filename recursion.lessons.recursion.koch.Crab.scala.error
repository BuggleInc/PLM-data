 required: ?{def /(x$1: ? >: Double): ?}
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2long in object Int of type (x: Int)Long
 and method int2float in object Int of type (x: Int)Float
 are possible conversion functions from Int to ?{def /(x$1: ? >: Double): ?}
