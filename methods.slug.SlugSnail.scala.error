The world 'Kitty' differs:
  In (0,1), there shouldn't be this baggle.
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Hunter':
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192].
