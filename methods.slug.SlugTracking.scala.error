The world 'Desert' differs:
  In (2,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (2,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (2,2), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (2,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (2,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (3,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (3,4), there shouldn't be this baggle, the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (4,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].
  In (5,0), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=255,b=0].

  Something is wrong about buggle 'Hunter':
    Its position is (6,2); expected: (3,4).
    Its direction is WEST; expected: EAST.
