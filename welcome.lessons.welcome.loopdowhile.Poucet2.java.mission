<h2>More buggles tracks</h2>

<p>Hu oh! Your buggle got lost again in the same kind of maze, but this time, the corridors are not 
always of the same size. That should not be a problem, as the code writen for the previous challenge
should work just fine here too: simply copy/paste it over.</p>

<p>However, if you cheated previously and used a <code>for</code> loop instead, your code will not 
work anymore... You must do as instructed this time, sorry ;)</p>
