The world 'Grid' differs:
  In (6,1), the ground reads '' (expected: '43').
  In (6,2), the ground reads '' (expected: '44').
  In (6,3), the ground reads '' (expected: '45').
  In (6,4), the ground reads '' (expected: '46').
  In (6,5), the ground reads '' (expected: '47').
  In (6,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '48').
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (6,0); expected: (6,6).
