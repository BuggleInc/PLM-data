<h1>Golomb sequence</h1>

The Golomb sequence is a non-decreasing integer sequence where a(n) is the
number of times that n occurs in the sequence, with a(1) = 1.

<p>Since a(1)=1, it means that 1 occurs only once in the sequence, so
a(2) must be different. Since the sequence is non-decreasing, a(2)
must be greater than 1. Since a(2)>1, the digit 2 must appear more
than one time in the sequence. So a(2)=2.</p>

<p>Since a(2)=2, there is two 2 in the sequence, so we know the value of
a(3). And so on for the other values of the sequence.</p>

<p>Write a function that computes the Nth element of the sequence.</p>
