<h2>Slug Hunting</h2>

<p>Now that your <code>isFacingTrail()</code> method is working, it's time 
to write the code to organize the hunting party. Copy/paste your code from the 
previous exercise, and complete the <code>hunt()</code> method.</p>

<p>Following a track is not very difficult: move forward as long as you have the track in front of you.
If there is not track in front of you anymore, check whether the rest of the track is on your left or on 
your right, and follow it further.</p>

<p>To ensure that you don't mix the track you come from with the one in front of you, 
the easier is to erase the track when you follow it. Use the method <code>brushDown()</code> 
to put your brush down and mark the ground, and <code>brushUp()</code> to move it up again.</p>

<p>Finally, do not forget to capture your prey once you found it (using <code>pickupBaggle()</code>).</p>


<h3>Exercise goal</h3>
<a name="Objectives">
Complete the <code>hunt()</code> method. You probably want to copy over the 
<code>isFacingTrail()</code> method that you wrote in previous exercise.
