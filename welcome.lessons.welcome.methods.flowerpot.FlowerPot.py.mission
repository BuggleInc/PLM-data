<h2>Flower Pot</h2>

<p>Your buggle decided to flower a bit the pot it lives in. You have to help it
reproducing the drawing of its dreams (check the "Objective" tab to see it).</p>

<p>For that, you have to write a <code>growFlowers()</code> method that does not 
take any parameter and does not return any result. As the pattern is a bit complex, 
you should try to decompose this drawing in sub-steps so that your code remains 
short and easy to read. A method to draw one flower of the color passed in 
parameter sounds like a good start, but it is probably not enough.</p>

<p>For your information, this drawing uses five colors that are listed below. 
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>Color.RED</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Color.PINK</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Color.CYAN</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Color.ORANGE</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Color.GREEN</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Color.YELLOW</tt></li>
</ul>
