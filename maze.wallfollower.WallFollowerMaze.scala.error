The world 'Labyrinth' differs:
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Thesee':
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192].
    It is not carrying any baggle.
