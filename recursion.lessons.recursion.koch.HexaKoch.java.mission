<h2>Snow hexagon</h2>

<p>This time, we will draw the curve that is known as the (6, 0.14)-Koch curve. This means that
you have to grow 6-sided polygons on the segments, and that the length should be multiplied by 0.14 
at each recursion level. </p>

<p>For the record, the origical Koch curve is the (3, 1/3)-Koch curve, 
the Snow square would be (4,1/3)-Koch curve while the Snow pentagon 
is also called the (5, 0.4)-Koch curve. If you want, you can switch to the creative mode in the menu 
and explore freely other Koch curves. Just change the initial call to hexaKoch to what you want.</p>
