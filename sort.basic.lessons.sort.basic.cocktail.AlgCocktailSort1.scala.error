Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method Boolean2booleanNullConflict in class LowPriorityImplicits of type (x: Null)Boolean
 and method Boolean2boolean in object Predef of type (x: Boolean)Boolean
 are possible conversion functions from Null(null) to Boolean
