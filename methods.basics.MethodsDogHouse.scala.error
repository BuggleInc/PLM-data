  In (1,1), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (1,3), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (1,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
  In (1,5), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0], but it is white.
