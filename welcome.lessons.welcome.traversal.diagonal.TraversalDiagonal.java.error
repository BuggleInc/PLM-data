The world 'Grid' differs:
  In (1,6), the ground reads '1 28' (expected: '28').
  In (2,5), the ground reads '2 29' (expected: '29').
  In (2,6), the ground reads '2 35' (expected: '34').
  In (3,4), the ground reads '3 30' (expected: '30').
  In (3,5), the ground reads '3 36' (expected: '35').
  In (3,6), the ground reads '3 41' (expected: '39').
  In (4,3), the ground reads '4 31' (expected: '31').
  In (4,4), the ground reads '4 37' (expected: '36').
  In (4,5), the ground reads '4 42' (expected: '40').
  In (4,6), the ground reads '4 46' (expected: '43').
  In (5,2), the ground reads '5 32' (expected: '32').
  In (5,3), the ground reads '5 38' (expected: '37').
  In (5,4), the ground reads '5 43' (expected: '41').
  In (5,5), the ground reads '5 47' (expected: '44').

  In (6,1), the ground reads '6 337 34' (expected: '33').
  In (6,2), the ground reads '6 397 40' (expected: '38').
  In (6,3), the ground reads '6 447 45' (expected: '42').
