The world 'Training World' differs:
  In (2,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  In (3,4), the ground is expected to be java.awt.Color[r=192,g=192,b=192], but it is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=255,b=255].
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Rookie':
    Its position is (4,4); expected: (3,3).
