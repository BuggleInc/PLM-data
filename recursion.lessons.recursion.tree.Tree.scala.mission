<h2>Trees</h2>

<p>We will now draw trees. For that, we will write a method using double
recursion following this prototype</p> 
<pre>árvore(passos:Int, comprimento:Double, ângulo:Double, shrink:Double)</pre>

<p>To draw a tree of four levels, you have to draw a trunk of the given length,
turn right of the given angle, draw a tree of level 3, turn left twice of
the given angle, draw another tree of level 3, and come back to your initial
location. Don't forget to come back to the initial location!<p>

<p>If a tree's trunk is of length 'len', the trunk of the next level tree will
be of length 'len*shrink'.<p>

<p>As you can see, each recursion level is represented by a distinctive
color. For that, you have to call the <code>current(step)</code>, passing
the current recursion level as a parameter. This will pick the right color
for you.  Don't erase your great colors when you move back to your initial
location.</p>

<p>If you get your function wrong, this can easily become hairly to debug as
your errors will appear at each level of the recursion, completely changing
the drawing.  For debugging purpose, you can use the <code>subtree()</code>
that will draw a correct subtree. This function is then very similar to the
one you are trying to write. The only difference is that
<code>subtree()</code> only draws in black. So, you can use it instead of a
recursive call to debug your code, but you have to change for a proper
recursive call to your own code (once it works)  to get the colors right,
and pass the exercise.</p>
