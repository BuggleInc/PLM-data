<h2>Run Four bases</h2>

<p>Today is a great day for the buggles: the Big Buggles' Race begun. It's a traditional competition 
in which young buggles prove their value to the tribe. Both force and intelligence is exercised: 
you have to rush forward, but stop as soon as you reach your fourth baggle. 
Please help the buggles to move forward while counting the baggles and to determine when to stop.</p>
