<h1>BubbleSort</h1>

<p>Welcome to the sorting universe. It allows you to experiment with the existing
sorting algorithms. The list of buildins that you can use in your algorithms 
is available in the world reference documentation ("Help"-&gt;"About this world").</p>

<p>It is not enough to sort the array to pass the exercises. Your solution 
must strictly follow the expected behavior of each exercise. This is
enforced by checking that your algorithm needs the same amount of read
and write operations to sort the array. </p>

<p>When your algorithm diverges from the expectation, understanding the difference 
between your code and the expected solution can reveal very difficult. To help in 
this process, it is posible to graphically explore the history of your sorting 
algorithm. Switch to the Objective view and use the contextual menu (right click) 
to switch from the the view of the current state to the view of its history.</p>

<p>The history view is a bit hairly at the first glance, but actually rather
simple: The time flows from left to right on this graph, and each row
is a cell of your array. The curved lines that go navigate between
rows represent a given data value. When two lines cross, this means
that two values were swapped at this time stamp; A line fork represent a 
value copy; When a value is magenta and followed by an interrogation 
mark (?), it was read using getValue(); If the value is red and followed with 
an exclamation point (!), it was written using setValue().</p> 

<h2>First attempt at BubbleSort</h2>

<p>This first sorting algorithm is the most simple one: Bubble sort consists in 
progressively moving up the smaller elements of the array, as if they were air 
bubbles moving up to the surface of a liquid. The algorithm traverse the array, 
and compare any pair of adjacent elements. If two adjacent elements are wrongly 
sorted, they are swapped. Once the array was completely traversed, the operation 
starts again from the beginning. When no elements were sorted after a full 
traversal, it means that the array is completely sorted: the algorithm can stop. 
Bubble sort is studied because of its simplicity, but it is almost never used in 
practice because of its bad performance (O(n^2) on average).</p>
