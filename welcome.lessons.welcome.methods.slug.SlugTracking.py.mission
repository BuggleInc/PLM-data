<h2>Slug Tracking</h2>
<p>
Your buggle is super happy! It just found the green dribbling trail, certainly left by a big yummy slug. 
At its end, the buggle is certain to entertain itself with this appetizing slug (represented as a baggle). 
</p>

<p>To reach that goal, you had to write a boolean method <tt>isFacingTrail</tt>, which determines whether 
we are facing a green cell or not. Of course, if we are facing a wall, it should return
false without bumping into it. You should make sure that this method has no <b>side effect</b>, i.e. that
it does not change the state of the calling buggle nor of its world.</p>

<p>Your tool to that end is the <code>getGroundColor()</code> that returns the color of
the current cell. Just go to the cell you want to test and run that function. 

So you just have to test whether the returned color is
equal to the value <code>Color.green</code>, that represents the 
green color.</p>   

<h3>Exercise goal</h3>
<p>Complete the <code>isFacingTrail()</code> method (which gets called automatically).</p>
