The world 'Grid' differs:
  In (0,0), the ground reads '048' (expected: '0').
  In (0,1), the ground reads '146' (expected: '1').
  In (0,2), the ground reads '343' (expected: '3').
  In (0,3), the ground reads '639' (expected: '6').
  In (0,4), the ground reads '1034' (expected: '10').
  In (0,5), the ground reads '1528' (expected: '15').
  In (1,1), the ground reads '447' (expected: '4').
  In (1,2), the ground reads '744' (expected: '7').
  In (1,3), the ground reads '1140' (expected: '11').
  In (1,4), the ground reads '1635' (expected: '16').
  In (1,5), the ground reads '2229' (expected: '22').
  In (1,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '28').
  In (2,2), the ground reads '1245' (expected: '12').
  In (2,3), the ground reads '1741' (expected: '17').
  In (2,4), the ground reads '2336' (expected: '23').
  In (2,5), the ground reads '30' (expected: '29').
  In (2,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '34').
  In (3,3), the ground reads '2442' (expected: '24').
  In (3,4), the ground reads '37' (expected: '30').
  In (3,5), the ground reads '31' (expected: '35').
  In (3,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '39').
  In (4,3), the ground reads '' (expected: '31').

  In (6,5), the ground reads '' (expected: '47').
  In (6,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '48').
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (0,0); expected: (6,6).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
