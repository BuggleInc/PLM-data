<h2>Building methodically</h2>

We now would like to learn the buggle to build a doghouse. The naive
approach consists in directly writing the needed code as follows.  This
works because the buggle of this exercise leaves a red path as it moves.

<pre>forward()
forward()
left()
forward()
forward()
left()
forward()
forward()
left()
forward()
forward()
left()</pre>

<p>It becomes harder when we want to draw two doghouses: we have to rewrite the
same code twice, which is not really handy. When the code becomes a bit long as this
one, it becomes easier to see why we insist since a while on the pure evilness that code
duplication represents. Indeed, if you realize that an error sneaked into a code that you
copied at several locations, you will have to fix it several times. And mind your back if you forget one of these locations.</p> 

<p>There is even a name to this good principle in programming: DRY/SPOT, which means
"Don't Repeat Yourself / Single Point Of Truth". The latter part means that each information
must be written in only one location of your program to avoid the differing locations to get
out of synch when you modify your code.</p>

<p>So, let's apply this good principle and <b>factorize our code</b>, 
ie to write it only once, for example in a method. You should even to go further by 
factorizing the method body with a <code>for</code> loop, as seen previously.
If you do it correctly (what you should), you can use the method <code>left()</code> only 
once.</p>

<h3>Exercise goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to write a method called <code>dogHouse</code>
achieving the same result than the code above, but with a for loop to keep it short. 
The buggle will call your creation to create several dog houses around its world. </p>
