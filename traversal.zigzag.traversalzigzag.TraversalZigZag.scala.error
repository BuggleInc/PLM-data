  In (0,5), the ground reads '' (expected: '41').
  In (0,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '42').
  In (1,2), the ground reads '14' (expected: '15').
  In (1,3), the ground reads '25' (expected: '26').
  In (1,4), the ground reads '27' (expected: '29').
  In (1,5), the ground reads '38' (expected: '40').
  In (1,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '43').
  In (2,2), the ground reads '15' (expected: '16').
  In (2,3), the ground reads '24' (expected: '25').
  In (2,4), the ground reads '28' (expected: '30').
  In (2,5), the ground reads '37' (expected: '39').
  In (2,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '44').
  In (3,2), the ground reads '16' (expected: '17').
  In (3,3), the ground reads '23' (expected: '24').
  In (3,4), the ground reads '29' (expected: '31').

  In (6,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '48').
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (1,5); expected: (6,6).
    Its color is java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=0].
    The color of its brush is java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]; expected: java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0].
