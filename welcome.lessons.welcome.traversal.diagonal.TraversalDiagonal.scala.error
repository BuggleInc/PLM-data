The world 'Grid' differs:
  In (0,6), the ground reads '6POULET2112POULET48' (expected: '21').
  In (1,6), the ground reads '7POULET2813POULET49' (expected: '28').
  In (2,6), the ground reads '8POULET34' (expected: '34').
  In (3,6), the ground reads '9POULET39' (expected: '39').
  In (4,6), the ground reads '10POULET43' (expected: '43').
  In (5,6), the ground reads '11POULET46' (expected: '46').
  In (6,6), the ground reads '' (expected: '48').
  Something is wrong about buggle 'Walker':
    Its position is (2,6); expected: (6,6).
