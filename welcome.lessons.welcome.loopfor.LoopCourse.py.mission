<h2>Training Buggle</h2>

<p>Today, your buggle wants to get some serious exercise: It wants to run 'till the track burns!
Its super-shoes are just perfect to run like hell, but unfortunately, they can actually damage the track on the long run...</p>

<p>Your goal is to run the track 10 times, no matter what happens. 
Even if the track suffers, you <b>really HAVE</b> to take that run.
Remember, the track has four sides, that take eight steps each to run along.
Now go, and show them what these super shoes can do.</p>

<p>You don't have to do anything particular with regard of the colors: 
your shoes will do it for you. Just take that run!</p>
